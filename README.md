This is my very own portfolio. Realised with **NextJS** and good old **CSS Modules**, it is made simply and is yet designed quite intuitively. <br/><br/>
Some of the _layout_ is inspired by Vercel, but everything is designed and made from scratch by myself.<br />

### What is this portfolio about?

In this portfolio I highlight the tools, frameworks and languages I use primarily, and provide a small view into what I offer as a developer.

### What tech and dependencies is being used?

As said in the introduction, this portfolio is made and served using following technologies:

- NextJS
- CSS Modules
- Typescript
- Vercel Hosting

Following primary libraries are used as of writing:

- geist
- radix-ui/react-slot + RadixUI/react-visually-hidden
- resend (_Form submission and Email forwarding_)
- zod (_Server side form validation_)
- react-icons

(...) plus named technologies and some formatting and linting tools. For more see `package.json`.

### What was the ideology and pattern behind this portfolio?

Here is a list of some of the ideas behind designing and coding the portfolio (referred to as "it"):

1. It _must_ serve a to a developer and devop engineer familiar looking website, as well as providing somewhat of a professional touch. The simplicity, spacing and coloring is key here.
2. It _must_ be able to be used for freelance projects and for job applications, serving as a Hub to distribute and share knowledge of other projects of mine and my skills.
3. It _should_ be able to be refactored easily, to meet new standards and goals (e.g. inception of a joint company).
4. It _must_ be largely accessible and obey WCAG, even if meaningful content is cut short.
5. Based on the _target audience_, it must serve in two languages: German and English.
6. It _might_ somewhat explain what is happening, even for non-techy viewers, based on the _target audience_.

### Target audience

1. **Target Group 1**<br />
   The primary target are employeers and lead developers of companies with certain backgrounds, looking to hire a new developer for a specific job or for longer periods, defined mostly through part- or full-time contracts. The background being either _(1)_ large sized company or _(2)_ medium sized company. The company's origin does _not_ matter, tho german companies are preferred, due to my current location.

2. **Target Group 2**<br />
   The secondary target group are local or regional businesses, trying to get a certain service, available options being described by the portfolio, for when comissions are open.
