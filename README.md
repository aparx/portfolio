This is my very own portfolio. <br /><br />
Realised with **NextJS** and good old **CSS Modules**, it's simple yet designed intuitively. Even tho some layout inspiration comes from Vercel, everything is designed and made from scratch by me.

## What is this portfolio about?

This portfolio showcases the tools, frameworks and languages I use primarily and offers a glimpse into what I can and want to provide as a developer. In either an existing team, or in freelance work (if currently possible). It shows what I am capable of and a little bit of my past work and learning history.
<br /><br />
The portfolio also contains a blog, being statically generated at compile time, even tho it is yet hidden. This feature will be expanded in future iterations, whenever more blog articles are to be published.

## What tech and dependencies is being used?

As said in the introduction, this portfolio is built and served using following technologies:

- NextJS

Some of the primarily used libraries:

Additionally, the already named technologies and dependencies, including some formatting/linting tools. For more details on what is used in the current build, have a look into the `package.json`.

## What was the ideology and pattern behind this portfolio?

Following is some of the principles and guidelines of designing and making the portfolio:

1. It **must** present a familiar-looking website to developers and DevOps engineers while keeping a professional touch. Simplicity, spacing and coloring are key.
2. It **must** be suitable for freelance projects and job applications, serving as a hub to distribute and share knowledge of other projects of mine and my skills.
3. It **should** be easily refactorable, in order to meet - potentially - constantly changing standards and goals (e.g. inception of a joint company).
4. It **must** be largely accessible and obey WCAG, even if meaningful content is already cut short.
5. Based on the _target audience_, it **must** serve in two languages: German and English.
6. It **might** provide explanations for non-technical viewers, based on the _target audience_.

## Target audience

1. **Primary Target Group**<br />
   Employers and lead developers of companies with varying sizes, looking to hire a new developer for specific jobs or long-term positions, defined mostly through part-time or full-time contracts. The company's origin does _not_ matter, even tho german companies are preferred due to my residence.

2. **Secondary Target Group**<br />
   Local or regional businesses seeking specific services, options being described by the portfolio, for when comissions are open.
